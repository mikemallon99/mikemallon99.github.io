Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with an interest in computer simulations and reinforcement learning. 

## Research Experience

#### University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

Worked under professor Christopher Schmitz in an undergraduate research group called Wagglenet, where I developed a user-friendly data collection device for bee farmers. The device was built to retrive data from several sensors simulaniously using the I2C protocol, and could output the data visually onto a portable screen. As the project advanced, I had the opportunity to recruit a few freshman and sophomore students and teach them how to contribute to the project.

## Work Experience

#### Illinois Rocstar

Worked as a software engineering intern at a private research company where I developed a C++ system for modeling heterogenous media as a periodic mesh, which could then be used to efficiently simulate military defense structures. 

#### General Lattice

Started as a summer intern at a additive manufacturing startup, and continued with the company as their primary software developer. I developed the company's MVP called GLStudio, which is a Rhino3D plugin that allows the user to generate and adjust complex lattice structures as BRep geometry. The plugin was published onto the Rhino3D marketplace, and gained 1200+ user downloads.

#### IBM

Worked as a cloud engineering intern to assist in IBM's Red Hat Linux acquisition, conducting research on how to use the Kubernetes auto-scaling feature to increase performance of deployments. Additionally, I developed a Python tool which cut costs by automating the deletion of unused AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud instances.

## Talks & Community Experience

#### Lights, Cameras, Engineering!
Contributed to [a talk about using video production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_MuZV90K7E&t) to communicate engineering ideas, where I presented about using creative transitions to make your videos more engaging.

#### Illinois ECE Building Covid Precautions
Created an [informative video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJd0eIpPmdk) to showcase the Covid-19 precautions the ECE building would be taking in the Fall 2020 semester. I wrote, narrated, and developed visuals for the video which was then posted onto the Illinois Facebook page for students to see.
